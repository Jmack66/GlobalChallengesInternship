Ideas going forward 
-----------------

get an SSH connection from the MAC to my Laptop --> might need to boot off of usb if I cant boot off of the SDIO 
	- from this can setup a simple python script for controlling the motors
		Controlling motors: Maybe using the PATA ports connected to the current drivers can write some kind of wrapper class to control the motors?? 
		Maybe look into controlling through usb ports or something? both sound kinda painful because we dont have a direct parrallel port i think 


Directly control motors with an arduino and move onto more mechanically oriented direction
