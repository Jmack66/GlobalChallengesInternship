Both boards use a PATA/IDE interface to the motherboard of the iMac this is what the massive 40-pin connector is to each board. They both also recieve 12v(yellow wire) and 5v(red wire) directly from the power supply.

After extensive searching, finding specific datasheets for the boards themselves or even the individual MPUs proved unfruitful.
